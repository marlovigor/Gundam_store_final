### `Fallen Gundam Store`

nteractive, scalable, 3D rendering of earth with nearby asteroids. Each asteroid is designed to reflect their relative size, distance from earth, and <br>highlighted to reflect potential dangers. User can interact in <br> all three dimensions, expand, shrink, and rotate using the mouse, touch, or keyboard. Data is dynamically rendered based <br> off of user click/touch.
